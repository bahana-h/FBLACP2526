# No API Key Needed! 🎉

This website uses **OpenStreetMap** - a completely free, open-source mapping service. **No API key required!**

## How It Works

The website uses two free services:

1. **Overpass API** - Queries OpenStreetMap for local businesses
2. **Nominatim** - Geocodes location names to coordinates

Both are:
- ✅ **100% Free** - No cost, ever
- ✅ **No API Key** - Works immediately
- ✅ **No Registration** - Just use it
- ✅ **Open Source** - Community-driven data

## Using the Website

1. **Enter a location** (city, address, or zip code) OR
2. **Click "Use My Location"** to find businesses near you
3. **Browse real local businesses** from OpenStreetMap!

## What Data You Get

- Business names
