- Only verified reviews (after passing verification) are accepted
- Average ratings are calculated automatically and displayed prominently

## Data Storage

The application stores all data in a JSON file (`business_data.json`) in the same directory. This file contains:
- All business information

The data persists between sessions, so your reviews and favorites are saved automatically.

## Sample Data

- Auto repair and other services (services)
